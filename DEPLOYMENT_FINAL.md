### Method 1: Manual Upload to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Prepare the Project**:
   - Zip the entire project folder (excluding node_modules)
   - Make sure `dist/` folder exists (run `npm run build` if needed)

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign up/Login with GitHub
   - Click "New Project"
   - Drag & drop your zip file or select folder
   - Vercel will auto-detect settings:
     - Build Command: `npm run build`
     - Output Directory: `dist/public`
     - Install Command: `npm install`

3. **Set Environment Variables** (see VERCEL_ENV_VARS.md):
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_email
   FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   DB_HOST=167.71.239.104
   DB_NAME=empl_data19
   DB_USER=sa
   DB_PASSWORD=Empl@786
   ```

4. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy" and wait ~2 minutes

### Method 2: GitHub (After Fixing Secret Issues)

1. **Create New Repository**:
   - Create a fresh GitHub repository
   - Clone it locally
   - Copy only the source files (excluding sensitive files)
   - Push to new repository

2. **Import in Vercel**:
   - Connect Vercel to your new GitHub repository
   - Set environment variables
   - Auto-deploy
