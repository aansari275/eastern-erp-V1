# Textile Manufacturing Quality Management Platform

## Overview

A streamlined textile manufacturing quality management platform built with React, TypeScript, and Firebase. The system provides department-specific workflows for Quality, Sampling, and Merchandising with backend-only role and access control managed through Firebase Authentication and Firestore Security Rules. User management is handled entirely on the server-side without frontend admin interfaces.

## Architecture

**Frontend**: React with TypeScript for robust user interfaces
**Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In
**Database**: Firestore for all application data (users, roles, rugs, quality records, buyers)
**Access Control**: Backend-only role management with Firebase custom claims and Firestore Security Rules
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design and dark mode support

- **Quality Control**: Construction type validation and quality mapping

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. Anonymous Firebase authentication on app load
2. User-specific data isolation using Firebase security rules
3. Graceful error handling for authentication failures

### Data Synchronization
1. Real-time Firestore listeners for instant data updates
2. Optimistic UI updates with error rollback
3. Structured data path: `artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/collections`

### Cost Calculation Pipeline
1. Material consumption × material rate calculation
2. Dyeing cost integration per material
3. Process costs (weaving, finishing, packing) per square meter
4. Overhead and profit percentage application
5. Final cost per square meter and total rug cost computation
